# Firefox-Media

This addresses my snowflake use cases, which are the following:

1) I want to be able to pause (or play) youtube from any tab
2) I don't want playing/pausing to mess with Spotify, as I usually
have Spotify open too. Frequently I go to Youtube for things that aren't
on spotify so having a designated youtube key makes sense.
3) I can't get firefox to recognize my media keys, but that's ok because
spotify would want them anyway. At any rate, I don't use F4 or fn+F4 on
my keyboard and I don't care to.

This spews errors into the console for the extension, but who cares?

Bootstrapped from https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1251795
found when googling about my problem. Also says stuff that doesn't work
for me RIP.

# Next Steps

BCI that figures out which tab I'm thinking of and just does the thing.
Seriously, I think any attempt to be smarter than this wouldn't work.
MRU and all that seem like they'd pretty frequently get the wrong tab.
Slightly considering taking away play functionality tbh.
